Simhouse is an interior design generator with an AI judge. This is an experience game designed to help people relax and de-stress with the ultimate goal of creating a professional grade interior design generator with the help of machine learning.

The project contains a multi-floor room generator written in Unity. An AI judge in pytorch ranks the generator output by comparing how similar the generator output is to professional interior design photos collected from online image search. The natural next step is to combine the 2 parts to train a policy to guide the generator to output high quality interior design directly.

The inspiration comes from the realization that visiting a great interior design space is a soothing and relaxing experience. I also have fond memories of spending hours build and designing houses in The Sims so this is an attempt to create a simulator to combine the 2 experiences.
